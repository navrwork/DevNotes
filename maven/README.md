## Maven Lifecycle

There are three built-in life cycles:
* default – This is the main life cycle of Maven as it is responsible for project deployment.
* clean – This life cycle is used to clean the project and remove all files generated by the previous build.
* site – The aim of this life cycle is to create the project’s site documentation.

### Maven Phases
A Maven phase is nothing but a stage in the Maven build life cycle. Each phase executes a specific task. Here are a few important phases in the default build life cycle

* validate –  This phase checks if all information necessary for the build is available
* compile – This phase compiles the source code
* test-compile – This phase compiles the test source code
* test – This phase runs unit tests
* package – This phase packages compiled source code into the distributable format (jar, war)
* integration-test – This phase processes and deploys the package if needed to run integration tests
* install – This phase installs the package to a local repository
* deploy – This phase copies the package to the remote repository

The phases are executed in a specific order and depend on each other. When you try to execute a specific phase, maven automatically executes all all preceding phases. For instance, when you call _mvn deploy_, mvn will also execute every lifecycle phase before deploy, in order: validate, compile, test, package, verify, install.

### Maven Goals
A sequence of goals constitutes a phase and each goal executes a specific task. When you run a phase, then Maven executes all the goals in an order that are associated with that phase. The syntax used is plugin:goal. Some of the phases and the default goals bound to them are as follows :
* compiler:compile – compile phase
* compiler:test – test-compile phase
* surefire:test – test phase
* install:install – install phase
* jar:jar and war:war – package phase
